**accounting.js** is a tiny JavaScript library for number, money and currency formatting, and excel-style column rendering to line up symbols and decimals. It's lightweight, fully localisable and has zero dependencies.

## Roadmap / to-do

* Write some more tests, docs and demos
* Do some optimisations for performance bottlenecks


## Changelog

### v0.3.0
* Rewrote library structure similar to underscore.js for use as a nodeJS/npm and AMD module - now you can go `npm install accounting`, and then `var accounting = require("accounting");` in your nodeJS scripts. 
* It also works with requireJS or any AMD module loader.
* **unformat** now only attempts to parse the number if it's not already a valid number (to save on processing). It's also aliased as `acounting.parse`
* Fixed an IE bug in the `defaults` method
* Numerous other bugfixes and little improvements

### v0.2.2
* Fixed same issue as #24 in **formatNumber**
* accounting.min.js now uses Google Closure Compiler, shaves 0.3kb+ off previous size
* Merged branch `gh-pages` and `master` and reshuffled to save hassle

### v0.2.1
* Fixed issue #24 where locally-defined settings object was being modified by **formatMoney** (still an issue in **formatNumber**, to fix)

### v0.2
* Compleat (non-breaking) rewrite of the formatting system for **formatMoney** and **formatColumn**, to allow more fine-grained control of string output, still easy as pie
* Separate formats for negative and zero values now supported (optionally) via `accounting.settings.currency.format`
* Added `isArray`, `isString` and `isObject` helper methods from underscore.js for readability/maintainability

### v0.1.5
* Added `map()` helper method based on underscore.js's `_.map()`, for array iteration, falls back to native `Array.map` if available.

### v0.1.4
* Added helper method `defaults` to extend an object's empty properties with a defaults object
* API methods now use **defaults()** to give more structure to the second-parameter-object method style: parameters are normalised into an `opts` object inside each method
* Settings object at top of library for readibility
* **formatMoney** now recursively formats arrays
* Added Jasmine test suite (thx [millermedeiros](https://github.com/millermedeiros)!) and QUnit functionality + speed tests

### v0.1.3
* Refactored library codebase to use a configurable settings object for default formatting parameters, which paves the way for plugins later on.
* Added `format` parameter to control symbol and value position (default `"%s%v"`, or [symbol][value])
* Made methods more consistent in accepting an object as 2nd parameter, matching/overriding the library defaults

### v0.1.2
* **formatColumn** now works recursively on nested arrays, eg `accounting.formatColumn( [[1,12,123,1234], [1234,123,12,1]] )`, returning back a matching array with inner columns lined up
* Another fix for rounding in **formatNumber**: `54324.535` now rounds to ".54" instead of ".53"

### v0.1.1
* Added **toFixed** method (`accounting.toFixed(value, precision)`), which treats floats more like decimals for more accurate currency rounding - now, `0.615` rounds up to `$0.62` instead of `$0.61`
* Minified version now preserves semicolons
* Fixed NaN errors when no value in **unformat** - revisit later on
